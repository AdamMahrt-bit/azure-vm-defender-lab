## Problem Proposition

Virtual Machines are vulnerable to attacks through brute force login attempts, malware, or unauthorized access. My lack of knowledge in the space of security can endanger my personal projects or future projects I am a part of.
<br>
## Goal
Learn how to secure a VM and monitor for threats while maintaining access for administration.
<br>
# Steps Taken for The Project
## Step 1: Created a Virtual Machine
- Provides the cloud compute enviroment <br>
- Learned Azure VM provisioning, VM sizes and understanding resource groups and regions <br>

## Step 2: Configured Network Security Group (NSG)
- Restricts network trafic to only use neccesary ports (SSH 22) <br>
- Learned port management and network security concepts <br>

## Step 3: Enabled Azure Defender for VMs
- monitors the VMs for vulnerabilities and suspicious activity <br>
- learned Azure Defender configuration, threat monitoring and understanding alerts and recommendations. <br>

## Step 4: Connect Using Bastion
- Secured remote access without exposure to public access <br>
- learned secure access methods and using Azure Bastion <br>

# Conclusion
Successfully deployed a secure VM in Azure that is monitored and protected from unwanted network exposure. This taught me how to implement foundational cloud security measures that make a VM safe.
<br>
# Key Takeaways
- **Limit Access:** Only Open necessary ports to minimize "surface area"
- **Monitoring:** Azure Defender provides proactive threat detection
- **Secure Access:** Bastion prevents exposure of credentials and IPs
- **Hand on Skills:** NSG configuration, Azure Defender, Secure connections, portal navigation etc.
